SignalR-Chat-application
========================

This is a chat application modified by going through https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki/QuickStart-Hubs


I successfully created a Basic chat application by going through quich hub documentation.. 
Now I am trying to add a advanced feature like whenever a user is online (connected to a server),
the server should show or broadcast the available online user's username to all the users connected to that server.
